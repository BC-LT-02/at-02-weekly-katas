# N-th Fibonacci

I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others.<br>

I would like for you to write me a function that, when given a number n (n >= 1 ), returns the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence.<br>

For example:

   `NthFib(4) == 2` <br>
Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.<br>

For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
